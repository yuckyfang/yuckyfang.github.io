        <h2>10 Usability Heuristics for Mobile AR Design</h2>
        <h3>
          Scenario
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Jacob Neilsen’s 10 usability heuristics are one of the most popular
          ways to evaluate how user-friendly an interface is. It’s most used for
          2D interfaces on mobile phones and computer screens, but what would
          this look like if we applied it to 3D environments like Augmented and
          Mixed Reality? Here are some UX and UI guidelines to AR experience
          design.
        </h4>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS</h3>
        <h4>
          The system should always keep users informed about what is going on
          through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Use visuals, text, and animations to help users start the AR
          experience. For example, when scanning for surfaces, use an animation
          of a moving device and text that says "Move phone to start scanning",
          so novice users know how to get started. You can also add visual grids
          or dots on the screen to show which surfaces are being detected.<br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          If scanning is taking too long, inform the users what surfaces and
          environments are ideal for AR before telling them to reset the
          experience. AR doesn't work well when you're scanning
          flat surfaces without texture or contrast (like white tables), dim
          lighting, extremely bright lighting, transparent or reflective
          surfaces (like glass windows), and moving surfaces (like rippling
          water).See an appropriate surface below.<br>
          <img class = "img-fluid"
               src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/ee9306d7-4d27-4c53-830a-b3ab57b2fa13%2Fgiphy-downsized-large.gif?v=1600225573625">

          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          When an object is placed, indicate it with haptic feedback, colorize
          it, or enlarge it so users know the action was successful. To see an
          onboarding example, search for “<a class = "contactLink"
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dinosaur&oq=dinosaur&aqs=chrome..69i57j46j0l2j46j0j46j69i60.1229j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
            >dinosaur</a
          >” in Google on an AR enabled device and see a tyrannosaurus come to
          life by clicking the “View in 3D” button. The app will place and
          colorize the creature as soon as a surface is detected.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Use spatial audio or visual cues to guide users where to look, what to
          focus on, and to encourage off screen exploration. This is especially
          helpful if there are objects and sprites outside the user’s current
          point of view and your experience wants the users to look for them.

          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          If using voice control, animate the mic button whenever the user is
          speaking and make sure they know the mic is on.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Let users know where they are in the experience if the app makes them
          travel. For example, Google Maps AR has a mini map on the bottom of
          the screen to show where the user is, where their destination is, and
          waypoints that updates live to guide them there.
          <img

          />
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">
          2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
        </h3>

        <h4>
          The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and
          concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
        </h4>

        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Use consistent physics, ensuring the virtual objects behave like real
          life objects and react to its real-world environments. If the users
          are playing with a bouncy ball, it should be able to bounce on the
          ground and the walls.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          The virtual objects should feel present in the real world and you can
          enhance it by using object occlusion. The virtual objects should be
          able to hide behind real world objects or be in front of them so they
          don’t only behave realistically, but also look realistic.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Add textures, shadows, and lighting to your objects to make them as
          real and believable as possible. Especially if your app is a utility
          app like Ikea’s, you don’t want to see an object that looks fake and
          out of place, or it defeats the purpose of showing customers what the
          furniture looks like at home. Avoid repeating patterns and flat
          colors. Instead, add visual noise like wrinkles if your object is made
          of leather or grains if your object is made of wood.
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">
          3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
        </h3>

        <h4>
          Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly
          marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to
          go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
        </h4>

        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Allow users to reset their experiences. Unexpected scenarios will make
          the users frustrated and giving them the freedom to reset when the
          camera is taking too long to track a surface, or when the virtual
          objects are not fixed to their position allows the users to continue
          the immersion. You don’t want them to be stuck with a bad AR
          experience and not have an opportunity for a better one.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Support undo and redo features so when an object is in an unwanted
          location, the users have the freedom to place them somewhere else. If
          an object is deleted by accident, the user can undo to get it back.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Let users play an animation again in case they missed it or just want
          to see it again. This is where interactive mechanics like selecting AR
          objects by pointing your phone at it or coming into proximity to
          trigger an action are powerful.
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">
          4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
        </h3>

        <h4>
          Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations,
          or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
        </h4>

        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          If you can, use subtle haptic feedback, such as a bump from the phone
          or 3D touch to increase immersiveness and responsiveness in your app.
          However do not use heavy vibrations or else it will shake too much and
          cause the phone to lose AR tracking. The type of vibration and touch
          feedback really depends on the device so make sure the haptic feedback
          is consistent with all types of devices.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Try using low frequency sounds to convey what the action would sound
          like in real life.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          When designing controls, use predictable interactive mechanics so
          users are already familiar with your controls and can expect it to
          behave like other technologies they have used before. You want the
          information in the system to appear more natural and intuitive. For
          example, when using familiar hand gestures like dragging, scaling, and
          rotating, many apps have you drag items with one finger, rotate and
          scale with two.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Anchor all objects in your AR experience to make it trackable anywhere
          you are looking at it

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Set minimum and maximum sizes for your objects

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Use large objects to get users to move around the object and see
          things at different angles. Make sure to not suddenly place it right
          in front of them though by adding some distance between the user and
          the object so it doesn’t surprise them and cause them to walk
          backwards

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Maintain a target size that’s easy to tap for every object in your
          scene. Even when you shrink the object, the target size should remain
          the same. Same goes for text. Text size should remain the same no
          matter how far or close the object is to maintain readability
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">5. ERROR PREVENTION</h3>

        <h4>
          Even better than good error messages is a careful design which
          prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate
          error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a
          confirmation option before they commit to the action.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Whenever possible, test your app with novice users to see if they
          understand the terminology and visual cues used. Make sure they feel
          comfortable!

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Thumb reach across the screen might shake the phone a bit too, causing
          the camera to lose AR tracking, so be careful where you place the most
          important and most used controls on your screen. The most important
          controls to the experience should be on the bottom while the ones you
          don't want the users to touch or the reset button should be on the top
          because it doesn't matter if the phone shakes too much when reaching
          for it.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Encourage users to take a break by pausing, making levels short, or
          saving their progress because holding the phone up for a long period
          of time is exhausting. Especially if it's an outdoor experience, users
          can be endangered when they're fatigued.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Tell users to look up from phone if they’re accelerating so they’re
          safe around their surroundings

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Respect personal space by making sure the objects don't suddenly pop
          up right in front of users, at severely close proximity, or the
          overwhelming size of the models will cause users to be uncomfortable,
          lose a sense of control over the AR experience, or worst, walk
          backwards and risk tripping. Microsoft recommends placing the objects
          at least 2 meters/ 6.56 feet away

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Let users know how much space your experience needs upfront:
          bedroom-sized model? Table-top game? Scavenger hunt around the world?
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">
          6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and
          options visible. The user should not have to remember information from
          one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the
          system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Offer an onboarding tutorial to show interactive mechanics in your
          app, such as voice control, hand gestures, and surface detection, so
          first-time users aren't lost when they use your app and give up before
          they get a chance to dive deeper.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          If space permits, use an AR badge that says “See in AR” or “View in
          3D" so first-time users know where to click to start their experience

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          When a virtual object is selected, show all the possible actions
          related to it, like changing colors, rotating, and playing the
          animation.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Make clickable things look clickable.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Related information is grouped together to help the user focus

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          There is good color contrast.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          The objects are discoverable and users know they can interact and how
          to interact with them just by looking at the design and reading the
          instructions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE</h3>

        <h4>
          Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the
          interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both
          inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent
          actions.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Accommodate various two-finger gestures like left and right thumb,
          index finger and thumb, etc… when rotating and scaling objects in a
          mobile AR app

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Allow users to skip information like the onboarding tutorial if they
          have experience with the app already

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Let users hide certain UI and information if it’s not important to the
          AR experience or else it will block the user’s view and cause
          discomfort with the overload of information. One of the laws in UX,
          the Aesthetic Usability Effect, states that users often perceive more
          aesthetically pleasing user interfaces as design that’s more usable.
          With limited screen space on our devices, it’s important to show the
          most important interactions and hide the less used ones for a
          decluttered, more aesthetically pleasing view.
        </p>

        <h3 class="highlightMe">
          8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely
          needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with
          the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative
          visibility.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          As much as you can, guide users visually with icons, animations, and
          motion over text as visuals are more universal and engaging. If the
          gestures are less familiar, then use both visuals and text to convey
          your message. An example is when the user first sets up their AR
          experience by moving the phone around to find surfaces. Just visuals
          or just text would be confusing to novice users but both actions would
          guide the users better

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Make sure the 2D UI is translucent or transparent so users can still
          see what’s in their surroundings through their phone. AR experiences
          must be safe to use, which means you must not clutter their view and
          block the user’s sight.

          Don’t use AR popups or else it will unnecessarily surprise the users,
          distract their attention, and block their view.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Text on top of translucent UI is more readable than transparent UI,
          but a bit less safe than transparent UI because it blurs the
          background. If the AR app is intended to be used in the real world,
          try to use transparent UI for greater safety. See comparison.

          Distinguish what controls are important and keep them fixed in one
          position, on top of the immersive AR environment. For example, that's
          why the capture button on social media apps like SnapChat and
          Instagram is always fixed on the bottom of the screen, above the
          camera content.

          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Minimize interruptions as much as possible if your app supports AR and
          non-AR experiences. For example, if you’re using an AR furniture app
          like IKEA’s, add a banner or carousel that lets users choose different
          objects to place in the scene rather than have them exit the
          experience each time to choose something new. See Google’s Search
          carousel for AR items.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Don’t bombard the screen with too much information or else users will
          lose track of their surroundings and the realism that comes with AR
          experiences. It will also distract users and harm them when they can’t
          see what’s around them. You should instead deliver more graphics
          gradually in small, controlled bursts. Remember, clear, clutter-free
          views.

          9. HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no code), should
          precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
        </h4>

        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Support both landscape and portrait modes by shifting important
          controls around when detected. But if not possible, tell the users
          which mode they should be on. (show google pic)

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Look out for environmental limitations that comes with AR by avoiding
          flat surfaces without texture or contrast (like white tables), dim
          lighting, extremely bright lighting, transparent or reflective
          surfaces (like glass windows), and moving surfaces (like rippling
          water).

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          If the user happens to encounter one of those environments, you should
          never blame the user but help them recover from errors instead. Guide
          them with clear, concise, everyday terms and don’t use language that
          mostly people who work in the industry would only know about, like
          “SLAM” or “occlusion” Examples below from Apple and Google.

          <br />
          • If an environment is too dark, tell them "Too dark to scan. Try
          turning on the lights or moving to a well-lit area." <br />
          • "Device moving too fast. Try moving more slowly." <br />
          • "Looks like camera is blocked. Try moving your finger or adjusting
          the device's position."

          10. HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
        </h3>

        <h4>
          Even though it is better if the system can be used without
          documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.
          Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's
          task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
        </h4>

          Use the onboarding tutorial to show users how they can start the
          experience and what the most important mechanics are in the app.
          However, make sure the tutorial is as compact as it can be because you
          don’t want to overwhelm the users with too much information. Humans
          have a short attention span on top of limited short term memory, so
          you need to show all the important mechanics first and allow for
          exploration after. This way, users can immerse in your AR app as soon
          as possible. One of the UX laws, the Hick’s Law,says that the less
          choices the user has to make, the faster and easier it is for them to
          start using the app.

          <br />
          <br />
          <i class="fas fa-asterisk"></i>
          Provide a FAQ of what users can do when they encounter problems that’s
          hard to explain in the experience or add a help button that documents
          common problems in the experience.
