           AR Drawing Web App  
        </h1>
        <h2>
           (Case Study in Progress)
        </h2>
        
        <h3>
           Scenario
        </h3>
        
        <p>
           This is a NSF funded research project where my professor, Ron Eglash, combines STEM, culture, and art to
          create a web app that kids can trace cultural designs they have coded online with, 
          onto paper crafts, body art, and textiles with Augmented Reality. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>
           Design Process
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          <b> Finding Target Audience </b><br> 
           "Kids" was a very broad target audience so with the consultation with my professor, 
          we decided to narrow down and focus on middle school and high school students as many teachers
          partnered with this project taught those grades. <br> <br> 
          
          <b> Interviews </b> <br> 
          With the target users in mind, I interviewed 10 middle school and high school students about what 
          they would like in an app that lets them trace anything they want on any surface. <br> <br> 
          
          <b> Market Research </b> <br> 
          To learn more about different AR drawing apps on the market, I utilized competitive analysis to gauge how AR drawing 
          apps are designed and developed, what the users look for and expect, as well as what users like and dislike about 
          their experiences. <br> <br> 
          
          <b> UX for AR Research </b> <br> 
          Since AR is an emerging technology and one that is heavily
          dependent on the experience, I made sure to research lots about UX for designing AR applications. 
          I read many AR Design guidelines from Google, Microsoft, Unity, Magic Leap, Apple, SnapChat, and Facebook as
          well as watched conference videos and talks about the evolving design. 
          I created a webpage on my findings <a class = "highlightMe" href = "arDesignProject.html" > here</a>. <br> <br> 
          
          <b> Key Takeaways </b> <br> 
          Learned that 
          <br> <br> 
          
          <b> Ideate </b>
          <br> <br> 
          
          <b> Mockups </b> <br> 
          Sketched several mockups of what the onboarding experience would look like and how the users would interact with AR.        
          
          Prototype #1 <br> <br> 
<!--           <img class = "img-fluid" src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/ee9306d7-4d27-4c53-830a-b3ab57b2fa13%2Faa.jpg?v=1600575670328"> 
           -->

          After much digging, I found a convenient solution that lets developers place 3D models in their surroundings with AR. I created a glitch 
          app (add glitch iframe here)
          
          
          Usability Testing & Iteration #1 <br> <br> 
          Tested the first design of the app with several students and they all didn't like
