          Web AR Drawing App

        <h3>
          <b> Scenario </b>
        </h3>

        <p>
          This is a NSF funded research project for building educational
          technology tools and curriculum that combines STEM, culture, and art.
          My professor, Ron Eglash, wanting to combine his drag-and-drop
          cultural coding tool
          <a class="highlightMe" href="https://csdt.rpi.edu"> (CSDT)</a>
          with physical crafts, decided to focus on Augmented Reality to bridge
          the two. We set out to create a drawing app for the web where
          students can trace cultural designs and 3D models they coded online onto paper
          crafts, body art, and textiles with AR.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <b> Time Period </b>
          <p>
            June - August 2020 <br />
            <br />
            Since this app will be used remotely during COVID-19, we made sure
            to design it so students would understand how to draw with it without
            physical guidance from someone else in the room. We also provided a
            feature where they can collaborate with their family members.
          </p>
        </h4>

        <h3>
          <b> Design Process </b>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Understanding Target Audience -> User Interviews -> Market Research ->
          UX of AR Research -> Ideate -> Mockup -> Usability Testing ->
          Prototype -> Usability Testing -> Iterate -> Key Takeaways -> Future
          Improvements
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b> Target Audience </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          "Students" was a very broad target audience and we didn't want to
          create a tool with just assumptions about our users so we narrowed
          down to middle school and high school students as the majority of
          teachers and students using this tool are in those grades. <br />
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b> User Interviews </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          With the target users in mind, I invited 5 middle school and high
          school students, had them test existing mobile AR drawing apps and
          communicate their thoughts about them, while I observed their
          reactions. We learned that:
        </p>
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. They want control over the opacity of the drawings they're
                tracing over
              </li>
              <li>
                2. It's tiring and inconvenient to hold up the phone with one
                hand while drawing with the other
              </li>
              <li>
                3. They want a tutorial to introduce them to drawing with AR
              </li>
              <li>
                4. AR often lost tracking on white paper which caused resonating
                negative feelings about the drawing experience
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>
          <b> Market Research </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          To learn more about different AR drawing apps on the market, I
          utilized competitive analysis to gauge how AR drawing apps are
          designed and developed, their distinct features, what the users look
          for and expect, as well as what users like and dislike about their
          experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b> UX for AR Research </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Since AR is an emerging technology and one that is heavily dependent
          on the experience, I made sure to research lots about UX for designing
          AR applications. I read many AR Design guidelines from Google,
          Microsoft, Unity, Magic Leap, Apple, SnapChat, and Facebook as well as
          watched conference videos and talks about the evolving design. I
          created a webpage on my findings
          <a class="highlightMe" href="arDesignProject.html"> here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3><b> Ideate + Quick Mockups </b></h3>
        <p>
         After the research, observations, and interviews, we came up with
          several mockups for our AR drawing app. One of the school activities was to
          code a 3D model of a wigwam then build a paper model from the design to learn about Native American architecture. 
          The first picture below shows what we imagined the experience would look like
          after the students coded their models and wanted to see their creations in AR. It displays a character who onboards the user with
          a mini tuturial on how to scan surfaces and informs the users when the environment is difficult to track. There's also
          a "Trace This" text to visually communicate what the users will do in the activity. It's 3D so you definitely can't trace 
          it on paper without a 3D pen but we wanted to get the students excited and intrigued about leaving with a physical craft after
          they complete the activity.

        After much digging, I found a convenient solution that lets developers
        place 3D models in their surroundings with AR. I created a glitch app
        (add glitch iframe here) Usability Testing & Iteration #1 <br />
        <br /> 

        One unexpected but crucial finding was how distracting the shadows of the reference image were. 
        One of AR's design principles is to create a visual presence by casting a shadow whenever the 3D objects 
        are interacting with the real environment but in this case, we found that the shadow hindered the students' ability
        to trace. The shadow acted as an extra noise the user had to shift their focus from and it often disrupted the flow
        of the experience.

        Tested the first design of the app with several students and they all
        didn't like Prototype #2 <br />
